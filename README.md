# Workout-Database-Heroku
Using python, store and access workout data [workout name, weight lifted, reps, date]. Eventually create a front end table input form, and then on the front-end allow for data access and manipulation. Then finally add an AI-component to make suggestions based on workout history. Then lastly, scale this so other users can create their own database.
