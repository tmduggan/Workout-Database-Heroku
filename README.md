# Workout-Database-Heroku
Using python, store and access workout data [workout name, weight lifted, reps, date]. 

Goals:
1. Create a front end table input form with a dropdown menu for the workout name, and then user entry for weight, reps, and date. The table clears upon submission.
2. Allow for data access and manipulation on the front-end. 
3. Add an AI-component to make suggestions based on workout history. Then
4. Scale this so other users can create their own database.
